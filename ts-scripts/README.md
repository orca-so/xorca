## Scripts

### 1. Status Script (`status.ts`)

This script displays the current state of the xORCA staking program without requiring any CLI arguments.

#### Usage

```bash
yarn status
```

#### What the script displays

- **Account Addresses**: State account, vault account, mint addresses
- **State Information**: Cool down period, escrowed ORCA amount
- **Vault Information**: Total ORCA in vault, escrowed vs non-escrowed amounts
- **xORCA Information**: Total xORCA supply
- **Exchange Rates**: Current ORCA ‚Üî xORCA conversion rates (with virtual amounts for DOS protection)
- **Summary**: Key metrics at a glance

#### Example Output

üè¶ Vault Information:
Total ORCA in Vault: 500000
Escrowed ORCA: 1800

```

### 2. Transfer ORCA to Vault Script (`transfer-orca-to-vault.ts`)

This script transfers ORCA tokens directly to the vault PDA (Program Derived Address) without going through the staking process.

#### Usage

```bash
yarn transfer-orca-to-vault <sender-keypair-path> <orca-amount>
```

#### Parameters

- `sender-keypair-path`: Path to the JSON keypair file of the sender
- `orca-amount`: Amount of ORCA to transfer (in smallest units, 6 decimals)

#### Example

```bash
# Transfer 100,000 ORCA (0.1 ORCA) to the vault
yarn transfer-orca-to-vault keypairs/deployer.json 100000
```

#### What the script does

1. Loads the sender keypair
2. Derives the vault PDA address using the state account and ORCA mint
3. Checks sender's ORCA balance
4. Verifies the vault account exists
5. Creates a direct transfer instruction from sender to vault
6. Signs and sends the transaction
7. Confirms the transfer and displays final balances

#### Important Notes

- This transfers ORCA directly to the vault without minting xORCA tokens
- The vault must already exist (program must be initialized)
- This bypasses the normal staking flow
- Use with caution as it may affect the program's accounting

### 3. Pending Withdraws Script (`pending-withdraws.ts`)

This script reports on all pending withdraws for a given staker address, including withdrawal readiness and timing information.

#### Usage

```bash
yarn pending-withdraws <staker-public-key>
```

#### Parameters

- `staker-public-key`: The public key of the staker to check pending withdraws for

#### Example

```bash
# Check pending withdraws for a staker
yarn pending-withdraws BQGjVjG8ZJW4m4hXybjLRB367idYyAHWbyjPBeL2w1hq
```

#### What the script displays

- **Pending Withdraw Details**: Each pending withdraw with its index, address, and xORCA amount
- **Timing Information**: Creation timestamp, time elapsed, and cooldown status
- **Withdrawal Status**: Whether each withdraw is ready or still in cooldown
- **Time Calculations**: How long until ready (if in cooldown) or how long since ready (if ready)
- **Summary**: Total counts and amounts of ready vs cooldown withdraws

#### Example Output

```

#### Parameters

- `deployer-keypair-path`: Path to the JSON keypair file of the deployer (must match DEPLOYER_ADDRESS)
- `update-authority-keypair-path`: Path to the JSON keypair file of the update authority

1. Loads the deployer and update authority keypairs
2. Verifies the deployer address matches the expected DEPLOYER_ADDRESS
3. Derives all required account addresses:
   - State account (PDA using "state" seed)
   - Vault account (ATA for the state + ORCA mint)
4. Creates an initialize instruction with the specified cool down period
5. Signs and sends the transaction with both keypairs
6. Confirms the transaction and displays the result

#### Required Accounts

The script automatically derives these accounts:

```

#### Parameters

- `current-authority-keypair-path`: Path to the JSON keypair file of the current mint authority

```

#### What the script does

1. Loads the current authority keypair
2. Derives the state account address using the xORCA staking program ID and "state" seed
3. Checks the current mint authority and mint data
4. Creates a set authority instruction to change the mint authority to the state account
5. Signs and sends the transaction
6. Verifies the authority was successfully updated
